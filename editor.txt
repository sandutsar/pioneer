Editor has two distinct modes accessed via command line parameters:
- System editor used for star system editing
- Model viewer used for model inspection
Without any parameters, the editor will not start.
The editor logs to ~/.pioneer/editor.txt on Linux and Documents/Pioneer/editor.txt on Windows.
	
		System editor
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		
This is a gui tool for editing and authoring json formatted star systems.

Usage:
~~~~~~
editor --system

Mouse controls:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<MMB> 			- rotate view
<Mouse wheel> 	- zoom view
<LMB>			- select body
<double LMB>	- center on body
<RMB>			- Edit context menu
<shift>			- faster navigation
<ctrl>			- slower navigation


Menus:
~~~~~~
File - commonly used file operations
	New system 	- create a blank system (ctrl+N)
	Open file 	- open an existing system.json (ctrl+O)

	Save As 	- save the system to another name (ctrl+shift+S)
	Quit		- Close the editor (ctrl+Q)
Edit
	Center on body 	- center view on selected body (double click)
	Add Child		- Add a child body to the selected object (ctrl+A)
	Add Sibling		- Add a sibling body to the selected object (ctrl+shift+A)
	Delete Body		- Deletes the selected body (ctrl+W)
	Sort Bodies		- Sort bodies in the outliner according to Semi-Mayor Axis
Windows - misc tools and shortcut reference

Outliner:
~~~~~~~~~
The left side panel shows the hierarchical structure of the system. The list is collapsible, and bodies can be selected either here or in the system view itself. The order of bodies can be customized, but that will not affect their distance from their parent body.

Right panel:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can edit the properties of the selected body in the panel on the right side. These are common astronomical and orbital parameters. For further information, the wikipedia article on orbital elements can be a good starting point.
Some parameters allow for unit switching (km, AU, light seconds for example) for more intuitive editing.
If the system from the outliner, its overall properties can be customized, such as its name, short and long description, galactic coordinates government, faction alignment.
Systems are placed in a 8*8*8 lightyears sector of the galaxy, indicated by three integer coordinates, and its position is then preciesely placed within that sector via its position coordinates. The origin point of the sector coordinate system is Sol.



		Model Viewer
		~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a simple tool to view a game model using the game's rendering engine.
It's main purpose is to test and debug models, and generally isn't for
end-user use.

Usage:
~~~~~~
editor --mv


Keyboard commands:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<cursor keys>		- Rotate the camera
<hold RMB>			- Rotate the camera
<Mouse wheel>		- Zoom
<ESC>			- Exit model viewer, prompt for new name or ESC to Quit.

Menus:
~~~~~~~~
There are a number of menus and other options on the top-left of the window:

Options: Toggles for several view overlays like collision mesh, tags, etc.
Model: Option to switch animation channels. Animation timeline and playback controls can be found at the bottom of the window.
Ship: Options to show ship features like thrusters, shields, weapons
	Show shields
	Linear thrust:
		Left/Right
		Up/Down
		Forward/Backward
	Angular thrust:
		Pitch Up/Pitch Down
		Yaw Left/Yaw Right
		Roll Left/Roll Right
	Reset thrusters
	Attach test guns
Grid toggles and grid scale
Lightig presets (all are attached to the camera)
	Front light - light shines approx from the camera
	Two-point 	- Two point lighting setup
	Backlight	- Light shines from the opposide side from the camera
The right side panels allow for examining the model hierarchy and show the model parser log.
